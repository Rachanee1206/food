            <h3>Hot pot</h3>

                Hot pot is a lively, communal dining experience where friends and family gather around a simmering pot of flavorful
                broth and cook a variety of ingredients together. Thinly sliced meats, fresh vegetables, noodles, tofu, and seafood are
                added to the bubbling soup, each ingredient taking on the rich flavors of the broth. Part of the fun is customizing your
                own dipping sauces, mixing elements like sesame paste, soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, and herbs to suit your taste. As
                the meal goes on, the broth becomes even more delicious, enriched by everything that's been cooked in it. Hot pot isn't
                just a meal—it's a warm, interactive, and social tradition that brings people closer over good food.

            <h3>Moo Kata</h3>
            <p id="p2">

                Moo kata is a popular Thai dining style that blends grilling and hot pot into one fun, interactive meal. At the center
                of the table is a special dome-shaped pan: the raised middle is used for grilling marinated pork, seafood, or
                vegetables, while the surrounding moat holds a flavorful broth for boiling noodles, leafy greens, mushrooms, and other
                ingredients. As the juices from the grilled meats drip down, they enrich the broth, creating deeper, more savory flavors
                as the meal goes on. Part of the charm of moo kata lies in its casual, social atmosphere—friends gather around the pan,
                cooking, sharing, and enjoying the evolving flavors together. It's an experience that celebrates both great food and
                great company.
